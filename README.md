# Deep RL Quadcopter Controller

*Teach a Quadcopter How to Fly!*

In this project, I designed an agent to fly a quadcopter, and then trained it using Deep-Q learning reinforcement algorithm.

Primary objectives in this project was to:

1. Design and build a task.
2. Build a Deep Q-Network.
3. Design and build an agent.

Other files are supporting files.
   
Test run output is stored in Testrun.txt file.
