# Deep RL Quadcopter Controller

*Teach a Quadcopter How to Fly!*

In this project, I designed an agent to fly a quadcopter and then trained it using the Deep-Q learning reinforcement algorithm.

The primary objectives of this project were to:

1. Design and build a task.
2. Build a Deep Q-Network.
3. Design and build an agent.

Other files are supporting files.
   
Test run output is stored in the Testrun.txt file.

Worth noting that this project was part of Udacity coursework, so you may find some of the boilerplate code too.
